# Achieving Operational Excellence with Steampipe and Powerpipe: A Platform Engineer’s Perspective

Operational excellence is a cornerstone of modern cloud operations, emphasizing reliability, security, and efficiency. For organizations transitioning from unstructured workflows—reliant on ClickOps (manual, GUI-driven cloud management)—to a more systematic approach based on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD principles, tools like Steampipe and Powerpipe can play a transformative role.

This article explores how these tools help platform engineers and the broader organization achieve clean, secure, and well-governed cloud environments, paving the way for operational excellence.

## Understanding the Problem: The ClickOps Legacy

In many organizations, early cloud adoption is marked by reliance on ClickOps—a manual, GUI-driven approach to managing cloud resources. While intuitive for small-scale setups, this method introduces several challenges:

- **Inconsistency:** Changes made manually lack version control and are prone to human error.
- **Lack of Governance:** Without structured management, it’s hard to ensure compliance with security and operational standards.
- **Scalability Issues:** As environments grow, manually managing resources becomes unsustainable.

Transitioning to IaC and CI/CD workflows addresses these challenges, but the path is often bumpy, requiring visibility into existing resources, their state, and potential risks.

## Enter Steampipe: Cloud Querying for Operational Insights

Steampipe is an open-source tool that uses SQL to query cloud environments. It provides a bridge between the unstructured ClickOps world and the structured IaC future by enabling:

- **Unified Visibility:** Query resources across multiple cloud accounts and providers with a single tool.
- **Security Insights:** Audit configurations for security risks, such as open ports, unencrypted data stores, or unused IAM permissions.
- **Operational Checks:** Generate real-time insights into infrastructure performance and compliance.

### Example Use Case:

A platform engineer transitioning an organization to IaC can use Steampipe to:

1. **Inventory all resources in AWS, Azure, or GCP using SQL queries.**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM aws_ec2_instance;
   ```

2. **Identify drift or misconfigurations compared to IaC templates.**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM aws_s3_bucket WHERE encryption_status = 'unencrypted';
   ```

3. **Generate compliance reports aligned with frameworks like CIS or PCI DSS.**

**Why It Matters:** Steampipe provides the visibility needed to assess and clean up messy, manually configured environments, setting the stage for structured IaC workflows.

## Powerpipe: Bringing CI/CD Principles to Operational Governance

Powerpipe, a companion to Steampipe, takes the insights generated by queries and integrates them into CI/CD pipelines. It automates governance and operational checks as part of the deployment workflow.

### Key Features:

- **Continuous Compliance:** Run Steampipe checks as part of CI/CD pipelines to enforce security and operational policies before deployments.
- **Drift Detection:** Identify discrepancies between IaC configurations and actual deployed resources.
- **Automated Remediation:** Trigger workflows to fix issues detected by Steampipe queries, such as enabling encryption on unencrypted databases.

### Example Workflow:

1. **Pre-Deployment Check:**
   - A Terraform plan triggers a Powerpipe check using Steampipe to validate compliance.
   - Non-compliant changes (e.g., opening all ports on a security group) are flagged and rejected.

2. **Post-Deployment Audit:**
   - After deployment, Powerpipe runs periodic Steampipe checks to ensure the environment remains compliant.
   - Detected drift is automatically logged for remediation.

**Why It Matters:** Powerpipe integrates governance into the CI/CD process, ensuring clean, secure environments at every stage of the deployment cycle.

## The Transformation Journey: From ClickOps to IaC Excellence

Steampipe and Powerpipe provide the scaffolding for organizations transitioning to IaC and CI/CD workflows. Here’s how they support this transformation:

### Phase 1: Discovery and Cleanup

- Use Steampipe to inventory resources and identify misconfigurations.
- Share reports across the organization to highlight risks and gaps in current practices.
- Engage teams to remediate issues manually or via automated workflows.

### Phase 2: Establishing IaC

- Begin codifying resources using Terraform, Pulumi, or other IaC tools.
- Use Steampipe to validate the accuracy of IaC templates against live environments.
- Deploy Powerpipe to enforce policies during IaC deployments.

### Phase 3: Operationalizing CI/CD

- Integrate Powerpipe checks into CI/CD pipelines to prevent non-compliant resources from being deployed.
- Monitor drift and ensure continuous compliance using scheduled Steampipe queries.
- Automate corrective actions with tools like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or custom scripts triggered by Powerpipe.

### Phase 4: Scaling Governance

- Expand Steampipe and Powerpipe usage to cover multiple accounts and providers.
- Enable cross-team collaboration by sharing dashboards and reports.
- Continuously refine policies and checks to address evolving business and security requirements.
